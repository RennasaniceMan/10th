wow, that was difficult, first of all sometimes you need delete the file and start anew because it will screw with you somehow.
I even used chat gpt to check for mistakes but it was for nothing and i was stuck before i created another file.
Second task is a frankenstein moster snitched from different parts of code found in the internet and processed with ai to connect it later. 
Sorry for such method but in my hubris i left myself too litle time to do that properly. It was a fisrt task to stupor me.
. Although to be fair i read about everything except for staticcode as i dont have any references to understand "what de fug"
