So... whats with the null? I read that there is some kind of mistake but i wasnt able to identify it without rewriting from ground up( and i didnt have time for that because i began too late... again) Lesson learned twice i guess.
 i also wasnt able to check properly any script but i ran it through ai and it said that most of that was fine. Modules were fine but not scripts. And for whatever reason i cant import class book from library... (although the part of the code was simply stolen for convinience.


Also sent the link to Bulatov because wasnt able to write to you in teams but due to zero reaction repeating the process here: sending the correct link for returned assignment. RennasaniceMan/9th at master-8th (github.com)
